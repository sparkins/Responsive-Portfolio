            <!-- Short Bio-->
            <p class="myBlurb">I'm orginally from London, although I did spend 5 years of my early childhood enjoying the sun, sand and sea while growing up in Cyprus.</p>
            <p class="myBlurb">When i was younger I spent 17 years playing club Rugby, at various levels.  I even spent a year playing for the San Jose Seahawks, when I first came to the States</p>
            <p class="myBlurb">I have been living in the Bay Area now for about 20 years.  And I am very lucky to have at home a beautiful wife and two kids.  
                My daughter, Chloe is 13, and my son, Nathan, is 11.  In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, as well as, watching the kids play soccer and basketball.</p>
            <p class="myBlurb">I decided to join the coding bootcamp in order to strengthen my technical skills, allowing me to consider a potential change
                in career.  Even within my current role and experience, this will give me more opportunities to advance my career in QA</p>
